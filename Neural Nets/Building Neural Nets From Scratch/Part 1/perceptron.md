## Using perceptrons to solve university acceptance problem


### The problem statement 

We’ve got a dataset containing the university admission data. Here’s how the data looks like, [here is the link to the jupyter notebook cell](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#fileId=1_u0KMavhqmyTsLCIce0ay7J9Aao-vE-H&scrollTo=AZIc9bRMc35B&line=3&uniqifier=1). Just make a copy of the notebook to run it yourself on cloud.
